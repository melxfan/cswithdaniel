1. What are the advantages of using generic classes?
/*
Stronger type checks at compile time. A Java compiler applies strong type 
checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. 
Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can 
be difficult to find.
*/
2. Create a generic class named Triple that has 3 type parameters and a variable for each type parameter.
Create a constructor that sets those variables.
Create get and set methods for each variable.
/*
class Triple <A, B, C>
{
    public A = first;
    public B = second; 
    public C = third; 
    public Triple = (A a, B b, C c);
    {
    public void setFirst (A a)
    {
        first = a;
     }
     public A getFirst()
     {
        return first;
     }
     
     public void setSecond (B b)
     {
        second = b;
     }
     public B getSecond ()
     {
        return second;
     }
     
     public void setThird (C c)
     {
        third = c;
     }
     public C getThird ()
     {
        return third;
     }
}
*/
3. Create a method named size in the MyArray class (see the video lesson) that returns the length of the array.

4. Create a method named add in the MyArray class that takes an index and a value and inserts the value into the array at the index.

5. Create a method named remove in the MyArray class that takes an index and removes the element at the given index.

6. Create a method named contains in the MyArray class that takes a value and returns
whether the value is equal to an element of the array. Use the equals() method.

7. Create a method named remove in the MyArray class that takes a value and removes the first occurrence of the value from the array.
If the value doesn't exist, do nothing. Use the equals() method.

8. Fix all errors:
public Pair
{ 
    A first;
    B second;
    public Pair<A, B>
    public A = first;
    public B = second;
    public Par(A a, B b)
    {
        a = first;
        b = second;
    }
    public void set(a, b)
    {
        first = a;
        second = b;
    }
    public void setFirst (A a)
    {
        first = a;
    }
    public A getFirst()
    {
        return first;
    }
    public void setSecond (B, b)
    {
        second = b
    }
    public B getSecond()
    {
        return second;
    }
}

  a. Why should a class such as Rectangle not be generic?
  //It only serves for Rectangles and not any other quadrilateral
  //so it cannot be classified as generic. 
  b. Consider the following code:
  
  class Rectangle<A, B>
  {
      A length;
      B width;
      public Rectangle(A l, B w)
      {
          length = l;
          width = w;
      }
      public double area()
      {
          return length * width;
      }
  }
  
  Are you allowed to do the following without errors:
  Rectangle<Integer, Integer> r = new Rectangle<Integer, Integer>(5, 7);
  System.out.println(r.area());
  //yes
